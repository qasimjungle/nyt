Title: Automating News Curation: Using RPA and Python for Efficient Web Scraping and Storage

Introduction: In the digital age, news is constantly updated, making it challenging to stay informed in real-time. To streamline this, I utilized a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) framework with Python to automate the extraction of news articles. This approach allowed me to efficiently gather, parse, and store information from The New York Times website in an Excel file for easy review and analysis.

Process Overview: The task involved three main components:

Automated Web Scraping
Data Processing and Structuring
Excel Storage
Each component was implemented using a combination of RPA tools and Python libraries to ensure reliability and scalability.

Step 1: Web Scraping Using Python
Using Python, I leveraged web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. While BeautifulSoup efficiently parsed HTML data, Selenium managed dynamic page elements, enabling me to interact with the site as a human would. For example, it handled scrolling to load additional content and clicking on article links.

Step 2: Automating with RPA Frameworks
To automate repetitive tasks such as initiating the browser, navigating to The New York Times website, and retrieving relevant sections, I implemented RPA. I set up specific instructions for the bot to search for targeted news categories, such as technology or world news. The RPA framework allowed me to set triggers to perform this process periodically, ensuring an up-to-date repository of news articles.

Step 3: Data Extraction and Cleaning
The extracted HTML content was parsed to obtain titles, publication dates, article snippets, and URLs. Data cleaning was performed to remove unnecessary tags, whitespace, and other formatting issues, which made the dataset ready for storage.

Step 4: Storing Data in Excel
Using Pythonâ€™s pandas library, the cleaned data was transformed into a structured format and saved to Excel. This step was streamlined with openpyxl for direct export, allowing each news entry to be recorded with the title, publication date, snippet, and a direct link to the full article. Each day's news entries were stored in separate sheets for better organization.

Conclusion: This project demonstrated the power of combining RPA with Python for automating web scraping tasks. By using this system, I was able to create a reliable, up-to-date archive of news articles from The New York Times. This process not only saved time but also provided a structured and accessible repository of information, readily available for analysis.
